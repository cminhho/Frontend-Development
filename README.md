## Worflow
+ [Yeoman Workflow](http://yeoman.io/): The Yeoman workflow is comprised of three types of tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app: 
    + [Yo](http://yeoman.io/) - scaffolds out a new application, writing your Grunt configuration and pulling in relevant Grunt tasks and Bower dependencies that you might need for your build.
    + [Bower](http://bower.io/) - the package management tool for the font-end made by Twitter. Installs and manages versions for font-end libraries like AngularJS, JQuery and Bootstrap. 
    + [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - a JavaScript task runner. Extensible via a large community of Grunt plugins.
+ [JSLint](http://jslint.com/) for detecting errors or problems by static analysis of JavaScript programs.
+ [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) for more flexible static analysis of JavaScript programs.
